/**
 * This function can be used to extract values from received UAVCAN transfers. It decodes a scalar value -
 * boolean, integer, character, or floating point - from the specified bit position in the RX transfer buffer.
 * Simple single-frame transfers can also be parsed manually.
 *
 * Returns the number of bits successfully decoded, which may be less than requested if operation ran out of
 * buffer boundaries, or negated error code, such as invalid argument.
 *
 * Caveat:  This function works correctly only on platforms that use two's complement signed integer representation.
 *          I am not aware of any modern microarchitecture that uses anything else than two's complement, so it should
 *          not affect portability in any way.
 *
 * The type of value pointed to by 'out_value' is defined as follows:
 *
 *  | bit_length | value_is_signed | out_value points to                      |
 *  |------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------|
 *  | 1          | false           | bool (may be incompatible with uint8_t!) |
 *  | 1          | true            | N/A                                      |
